# Case Study: *Frozen Rents, Hot Debate: Berlin’s Mietendeckel and the Economics of Rent Control*

<!--
## Case Synopsis (Instructor Version)

In February 2020, the Berlin Senate implemented one of the most ambitious rent control policies in Europe, known as the *Mietendeckel* (rent cap). The law froze rents for five years at mid-2019 levels, restricted rent increases, and penalized landlords who charged above government-mandated thresholds. This policy was a response to rising rents and growing public discontent, especially among younger, lower-income tenants. However, critics warned that the rent cap would reduce housing supply, discourage investment, and create inefficiencies.

A year later, preliminary data began to emerge: the number of rental listings in the regulated segment dropped sharply, new construction slowed, and landlords began shifting properties into owner-occupation or the unregulated segment. At the same time, tenants in capped apartments reported tangible savings. In 2021, Germany’s Constitutional Court overturned the law, declaring that Berlin had overstepped its legislative authority — but the political and economic debate continues.

Students are placed in the role of economic advisors tasked with analyzing the policy’s effects and advising another European city considering similar regulation. They must assess both theoretical and empirical outcomes and reflect on the persistence of such policies despite their well-known downsides in economic models.

## Case

**Berlin, Winter 2021.**  
The capital was in turmoil. Over the last decade, rents had more than doubled in many central neighborhoods, pricing out students, artists, and working-class families. With protest slogans like *"Housing for people, not for profit,"* activists pressured lawmakers to take bold action.

In response, Berlin’s state government passed the *Mietendeckel* — a rent freeze that applied retroactively to all units built before 2014. Overnight, landlords were prohibited from increasing rents and, in some cases, forced to lower them. The policy promised stability for tenants but provoked outcry from property owners and developers.

In the months that followed, the effects began to surface:

- The number of rental listings on Berlin’s largest platform (*Immobilienscout24*) dropped by more than **50%** in the regulated segment.
- Some landlords **withdrew units from the rental market**, converting them into owner-occupied or short-term holiday rentals.
- Investors began shifting capital to **unregulated housing markets** in nearby cities like Leipzig and Dresden.
- Rent levels **fell** in capped units, but **rose** in newly built or exempted properties.

Then came the shock: in April 2021, the German Constitutional Court struck down the law. Tenants were required to repay some of the “excess” rent they had saved under the cap. The political debate intensified.

## Task 1: Economic Analysis (Group Work)

You are a team of economic advisors evaluating whether another city (e.g., Barcelona, Dublin, or Vienna) should adopt a similar rent control law.

Apply **rigorous economic reasoning** to the following questions:

1. **Graphical Analysis**: Use a standard supply and demand diagram to illustrate what happens when a binding price ceiling is imposed on rents. What is the short-run vs. long-run effect on housing supply?
2. **Elasticity and Market Outcomes**: How does the elasticity of supply and demand affect the magnitude of shortages or misallocation?
3. **Efficiency and Equity**: Who gains and who loses from rent control? Discuss in terms of consumer surplus, producer surplus, and deadweight loss.
4. **Unintended Consequences**: What were the observed distortions in the Berlin case? How might landlords respond strategically to such regulation?
5. **Alternative Solutions**: Are there better policies to achieve affordable housing? Consider housing subsidies, construction incentives, or zoning reform.

Prepare a short presentation outlining your analysis and concluding with a policy recommendation.

## Task 2: Policy Persistence and Political Economy (Plenary Discussion)

Despite clear inefficiencies predicted by economic theory, rent controls are popular and politically persistent.

Discuss:

1. **Why do rent controls remain politically attractive**, even when economists broadly oppose them?
2. **What role do interest groups, media framing, and voter behavior** play in supporting such interventions?
3. **Can you identify trade-offs between economic efficiency and political legitimacy** in this context?

## Teaching Objectives

By the end of this case, students should be able to:

- Apply microeconomic theory to real-world policy interventions
- Distinguish between short-run and long-run market dynamics
- Identify and evaluate unintended consequences of price controls
- Understand the gap between normative economic analysis and political feasibility
- Construct a reasoned argument combining data, theory, and policy perspective
